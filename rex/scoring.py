"""Phase-1 scoring + feedback.

score_plan -> (score in [0,1], feedback): GRADED, not binary.
  0.30 * diagnosis_correct  +  0.25 * correct_fix_present  +  0.45 * resolved
  minus a BIG penalty (0.60) if any trap/forbidden action appears.

A1: diagnosis_correct is decided by an LLM-judge that maps the model's STATED root
cause to the gold root (phrasing-robust) and rejects red herrings — NOT exact
keyword match. The judge is injectable (judge_fn) so the loop/tests are deterministic.
